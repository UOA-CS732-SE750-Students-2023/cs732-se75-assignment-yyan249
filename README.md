 ## demo description
 this is a data visualisation website by using the library echarts-for-react, which is a powerful libraray.
 React wrapper of Apache ECharts that is easy to use and best. It was very easy to use and included all the features I needed when I developed my webpage with it. It had a good balance between simplicity and flexibility.

 The website is using the data visualisation to help people being able to monitor the weather easily as the climate has been changing.
