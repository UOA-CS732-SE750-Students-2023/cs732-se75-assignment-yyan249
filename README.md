## demo description
 This is a data visualisation website by using the library echarts-for-react, which is a powerful library.
 
 React wrapper of Apache ECharts that is easy to use and best. 
 
 It was very easy to use and included all the features I needed when I developed my webpage with it. It had a good balance   between simplicity and flexibility.
 
 The website is using the data visualisation to help people being able to monitor the weather easily as the climate has been changing.
